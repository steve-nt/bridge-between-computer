QUICK CHECKLIST - IS IT WORKING?
================================================================================

RIGHT NOW, check these things:

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE CHECKS (in PowerShell windows)
================================================================================

☐ Both PowerShell windows are still running (not crashed)?
☐ See "[worker X] req #N status=200" messages?
☐ Both windows showing request activity?
☐ No Python errors in either window?

If YES to all above: ✓ Load is being sent! It's working!

================================================================================
AWS CONSOLE CHECKS (open browser now!)
================================================================================

Go to: AWS Console > CloudWatch > Dashboards > D7078E-Mini-Project-Dashboard

Check these metrics NOW:

☐ CPU Utilization: Is it rising? (should be 30%+ by now if scripts running Phase 1/2)
  └─ If at 0%: Something wrong
  └─ If rising: ✓ IT'S WORKING!

☐ RequestCount: Is there activity? (should show numbers)
  └─ If 0: Not sending requests
  └─ If showing values: ✓ IT'S WORKING!

☐ HealthyHostCount: Still showing 1 for now (normal, Phase 3 is when scaling happens)
  └─ If showing values: ✓ Normal!

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. WAIT 10-15 MINUTES
   └─ Let scripts reach Phase 3 (both at same time)
   └─ This is when combined 2500 RPS load starts

2. AROUND MINUTE 12-15
   └─ CPU should spike to 80%+
   └─ Alarms should trigger
   └─ Scaling should begin

3. WATCH FOR SCALING
   └─ HealthyHostCount: 1 → 2 → 3
   └─ ASG Activity: "Launching 1 new instance" messages
   └─ EC2 Instances: count increases

4. TAKE SCREENSHOTS
   └─ Of the scaling events
   └─ Proof that it worked!

================================================================================
EXPECTED TIMING
================================================================================

Phase timing (both scripts synchronized):

0-5 min:   Both Phase 1 (50 + 200 = 250 RPS)
5-10 min:  Both Phase 2 (200 + 800 = 1000 RPS)
10-25 min: Both Phase 3 (500 + 2000 = 2500 RPS) ← SCALING HERE!
25-30 min: Both winding down

CRITICAL MOMENT: Minutes 10-20
  └─ This is when you'll see scaling happen
  └─ Watch dashboard during this time

================================================================================
MOST LIKELY OUTCOME
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: It works perfectly ✓
  ├─ You'll see CPU spike
  ├─ Alarms trigger
  ├─ Instances scale 1→2→3
  ├─ RequestCount shows 2000+ RPS
  └─ AMAZING RESULTS! 🎉

SCENARIO 2: Slow to scale
  ├─ CPU high but instances not launching yet
  ├─ Reason: Alarms take 2-5 minutes to evaluate
  ├─ Solution: Wait longer
  └─ Will eventually work ✓

SCENARIO 3: Some requests fail
  ├─ ALB might drop some requests under extreme load
  ├─ This is NORMAL for 2500 RPS on t2.micro
  ├─ Some requests fail = Expected
  └─ Scaling will still happen ✓

SCENARIO 4: One script crashes
  ├─ One of the scripts might crash
  ├─ Other continues running
  ├─ You'll still see scaling from remaining script
  └─ Still counts as success ✓

================================================================================
DON'T PANIC IF...
================================================================================

Don't worry if:
  ⚠️ You see connection errors (some requests may fail)
  ⚠️ CPU doesn't spike immediately (gives Phase 1/2 time)
  ⚠️ Scaling takes a few minutes (alarm evaluation time)
  ⚠️ One script has issues (other may work fine)
  ⚠️ Instances aren't showing instantly (they boot in 1-2 minutes)

All of these are normal under extreme load!

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW
================================================================================

1. Look at your PowerShell windows
   └─ Are they showing request activity? YES = Good!

2. Open AWS Console
   └─ CloudWatch Dashboard
   └─ Check CPU and RequestCount
   └─ If showing activity = Good!

3. WAIT 10 MINUTES
   └─ Let scripts reach Phase 3
   └─ This is when the magic happens

4. MONITOR CLOSELY
   └─ Minutes 10-20 are critical
   └─ Watch for CPU spike and scaling

5. TAKE SCREENSHOTS
   └─ When you see HealthyHostCount increase
   └─ Proof of success!

================================================================================
YOU'RE DOING GREAT!
================================================================================

You're running a 2500 RPS concurrent load test! That's IMPRESSIVE!

Even if some requests fail, even if scaling takes a minute longer,
you're stress-testing your infrastructure at EXTREME levels!

Just keep both scripts running and monitor the dashboard.

In 5-10 minutes, you should see the magic happen! 🚀

Trust the process! It will work! ✅
