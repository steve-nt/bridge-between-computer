TIPS FOR TAKING QUALITY SCREENSHOTS
================================================================================

1. CLARITY:
   ✓ Make sure AWS console is clearly visible
   ✓ Zoom in if text is too small
   ✓ Include full window (title bar + content)
   ✓ Avoid blurriness

2. TIMING:
   ✓ For metrics: Wait until graph is stable
   ✓ For alarms: Capture at exact state change
   ✓ For activity logs: Show complete timeline

3. READABILITY:
   ✓ Highlight key information if needed
   ✓ Include instance IDs, ARNs, DNS names
   ✓ Timestamp visible in CloudWatch graphs

4. CONSISTENCY:
   ✓ Use same resolution for all screenshots
   ✓ Same zoom level within each section
   ✓ Consistent file naming convention

5. EVIDENCE:
   ✓ Each screenshot should tell part of the story
   ✓ Progression should be obvious
   ✓ Metrics should correlate with actions

KEY MOMENTS TO CAPTURE (DO NOT MISS THESE!)
================================================================================

TASK 1:
  🔴 CRITICAL: /burn endpoint causing CPU spike in CloudWatch
  🔴 CRITICAL: AMI created and "Available" status

TASK 2:
  🔴 CRITICAL: ALB in "Active" state
  🔴 CRITICAL: All 1 target showing "Healthy"

TASK 3:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Both alarms created and in "OK" state
  🔴 CRITICAL: Both scaling policies "Active"

TASK 4: (MOST IMPORTANT!)
  🔴 CRITICAL: Baseline metrics before load
  🔴 CRITICAL: Alarm transitions to "IN_ALARM" at 80%
  🔴 CRITICAL: ASG Activity showing "Launching 1 instances"
  🔴 CRITICAL: HealthyHostCount transition 1→2→3
  🔴 CRITICAL: All 3 instances "Healthy" in target group
  🔴 CRITICAL: Final metrics with all 3 instances

TASK 5:
  🔴 CRITICAL: Instance marked "Unhealthy" when failure happens
  🔴 CRITICAL: ASG launching replacement instance
  �� CRITICAL: All 3 instances healthy again (recovery)

TASK 6:
  🔴 CRITICAL: All resources deleted
  🔴 CRITICAL: Complete activity log before cleanup
  🔴 CRITICAL: Empty console (all resources gone)

END OF SCREENSHOT GUIDE

Use this guide to systematically document your lab work. Each screenshot
serves as evidence of a completed step. Together, they tell the complete
story of auto-scaling infrastructure in action!
