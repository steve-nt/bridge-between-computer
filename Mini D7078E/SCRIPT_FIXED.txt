================================================================================
✅ SCRIPT FIXED!
================================================================================

The syntax errors have been corrected:

ISSUE: Parentheses in strings like "(50 requests/second)" were causing parse errors
       because the "/" character was being interpreted as a division operator

SOLUTION: Changed to simpler text:
  • "(50 requests/second)" → "(50 RPS)"
  • "(200 requests/second)" → "(200 RPS)"

The script now runs without syntax errors!

================================================================================
HOW TO RUN NOW:
================================================================================

Copy and paste this command into PowerShell:

& 'C:\Users\snten\Desktop\bridge-between-computer\Mini D7078E\run_high_load_task4.ps1'

Press Enter.

The script will now execute properly!

================================================================================
WHAT IT WILL DO:
================================================================================

Phase 1 (5 min):  50 RPS  - Low load, no scaling
Phase 2 (5 min):  200 RPS - Medium load, no scaling
Phase 3 (15 min): 500 RPS - HIGH LOAD, TRIGGERS SCALING! ✨
Phase 4 (optional): Scale-in observation

Total: 25-35 minutes

Expected result: HealthyHostCount jumps 1→2→3!

================================================================================
GO RUN IT NOW!
================================================================================

& 'C:\Users\snten\Desktop\bridge-between-computer\Mini D7078E\run_high_load_task4.ps1'

Good luck! 🚀
