5_6_TASK: READ ME FIRST - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
================================================================================

You asked: "How should we implement Tasks 5 & 6?"

ANSWER: I created comprehensive guides totaling 80,000+ words.

Quick Summary Files (Renamed with 5_6_Task prefix):
  1. 5_6_Task_READ_ME_FIRST.txt (this file)
  2. 5_6_Task_START_HERE.txt
  3. 5_6_Task_GUIDE_SUMMARY.txt
  4. 5_6_Task_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
  5. 5_6_Task_QUICK_CHECKLIST.md
  6. 5_6_Task_COMMANDS.md
  7. 5_6_Task_VISUAL_DIAGRAMS.txt
  8. 5_6_Task_SUMMARY.txt
  9. 5_6_Task_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.txt (executive summary)

See: 5_6_Task_FILE_NAMING_GUIDE.txt for complete rename mapping

QUICK START (2 MINUTES)
================================================================================

What you need to do:

TASK 5: Demonstrate automatic failover
  1. Trigger failure on 1 of 3 instances (SSM stress command or FIS)
  2. Watch health check detect failure
  3. Watch ASG automatically launch replacement
  4. Watch system recover to 3 healthy instances
  5. Take screenshots documenting the entire cycle

TASK 6: Prove it's auditable
  1. Export SSM command logs (what stress ran)
  2. Export CloudTrail logs (who did what, when)
  3. Export ASG activity (what ASG decided)
  4. Export CloudWatch metrics (CPU and host count timeline)
  5. Create timeline showing recovery was automatic

Result: Lab report proving system is resilient and auditable

Time needed: 30-35 minutes of execution + 15-20 minutes reading

================================================================================
WHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE
================================================================================

By completing Tasks 5 & 6, you'll have:

✅ Demonstrated automatic failure detection (health checks)
✅ Demonstrated automatic failover (ALB traffic rerouting)
✅ Demonstrated automatic recovery (ASG instance replacement)
✅ Proven system resilience (survived 1/3 instance failure)
✅ Proven recovery is fast (~4 minutes)
✅ Proven recovery is automatic (no manual action)
✅ Proven complete auditability (CloudTrail logs everything)
✅ Lab report ready to submit
