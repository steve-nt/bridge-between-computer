\section*{Abstract}

The D7078E Cloud Security Mini Project focuses on designing and implementing a resilient, auto-scaling web infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with emphasis on observability, failure simulation, and recovery mechanisms. The project demonstrates core cloud security and reliability principles through the deployment of an Application Load Balancer (ALB), Auto Scaling Group (ASG), and CloudWatch monitoring. Key objectives include configuring a launch template with a custom web application, establishing CPU-based auto-scaling policies (scale-out at ≥80% CPU, scale-in at ≤30% CPU), implementing internal load generation with Python agents, and simulating controlled failure scenarios to observe health check behavior, instance replacement, and automatic failover. The project integrates multiple AWS services---EC2, ALB, Target Groups, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms, Systems Manager (SSM), and CloudTrail---to create a production-grade infrastructure capable of self-healing from instance failures. Through systematic load testing and failure simulation, the lab demonstrates how health checks trigger automatic instance replacement, how load balancing redistributes traffic away from unhealthy instances, and how auto-scaling groups maintain desired capacity during both normal operations and degraded conditions. Results confirm that properly configured health checks, scaling policies, and monitoring enable rapid detection and recovery from infrastructure failures, achieving high availability and service resilience. Overall, this project illustrates essential cloud security and reliability practices: infrastructure automation, continuous monitoring, controlled chaos testing, and the implementation of self-healing systems that maintain availability without manual intervention.
