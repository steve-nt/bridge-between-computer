RUNNING BOTH SCRIPTS SIMULTANEOUSLY
================================================================================

QUESTION: What happens if we run both run_high_load.ps1 AND run_max_load.ps1 
at the same time?

ANSWER: You get COMBINED LOAD!

================================================================================
LOAD CALCULATION
================================================================================

run_high_load.ps1 (Phase 3):
  100 workers × 5 RPS = 500 RPS

run_max_load.ps1 (Phase 3):
  400 workers × 5 RPS = 2000 RPS

COMBINED (both running Phase 3 simultaneously):
  500 RPS + 2000 RPS = 2500 RPS TOTAL! 🚀

That's 5x the standard load!

================================================================================
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
================================================================================

Timeline:

Minute 0-5 (Both Phase 1 + 2):
  ├─ high_load.ps1 Phase 1: 50 RPS
  └─ max_load.ps1 Phase 1: 200 RPS
  Total: 250 RPS
  CPU: 30-40%
  Status: Ramping up

Minute 5-10 (Both Phase 2):
  ├─ high_load.ps1 Phase 2: 200 RPS
  └─ max_load.ps1 Phase 2: 800 RPS
  Total: 1000 RPS
  CPU: 70-80%
  Status: Getting high, may start scaling

Minute 10-25 (Both Phase 3) - THE INTERESTING PART:
  ├─ high_load.ps1 Phase 3: 500 RPS
  └─ max_load.ps1 Phase 3: 2000 RPS
  Total: 2500 RPS COMBINED!
  CPU: 90%+ EXTREME
  Hosts: Should scale to 3 quickly
  Status: MAXIMUM STRESS!

Result: EXTREME scaling, rapid instance launches, sustained 2500 RPS!

================================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

CPU Utilization:
  Would spike to 90%+ immediately in Phase 3
  Stay high for entire duration
  Sustained at maximum

RequestCount:
  Phase 1: ~250 requests/second
  Phase 2: ~1000 requests/second
  Phase 3: ~2500 requests/second (HUGE!)

HealthyHostCount:
  Phase 1: 1
  Phase 2: 1 (possibly 2)
  Phase 3: Will scale 1→2→3 VERY QUICKLY
  May trigger multiple rapid scaling events

ASG Activity:
  Would show rapid "Launching instances" events
  Possibly multiple launch events within seconds
  May even reach 3 instances before Phase 3 ends

Result: EXTREME load test showing auto-scaling under MAXIMUM stress!

================================================================================
ADVANTAGES OF RUNNING BOTH
================================================================================

✓ Test auto-scaling at true maximum capacity
✓ See how fast instances launch under extreme load
✓ Show load balancer performance
✓ Demonstrate true system limits
✓ Very impressive results
✓ Undeniable proof of auto-scaling
✓ Stress test the entire infrastructure

================================================================================
POTENTIAL ISSUES
================================================================================

⚠️ WARNING: This is VERY AGGRESSIVE!

Possible issues:
1. ALB might be overloaded
   - May drop some requests
   - Response times might spike

2. Instances might not keep up
   - Health checks might fail
   - Some requests may timeout

3. Network might be saturated
   - Depending on your internet connection
   - Could affect your local machine

4. AWS might throttle
   - Rate limiting on ALB
   - Connection limits reached

5. Your machine might struggle
   - Both Python processes running simultaneously
   - CPU usage on your local machine would be very high

Solution: Monitor carefully, may need to reduce load if issues occur

================================================================================
HOW TO RUN BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY
================================================================================

OPTION 1: Two separate PowerShell windows (RECOMMENDED)

Step 1: Open PowerShell Window 1
  cd 'C:\Users\snten\Desktop\bridge-between-computer\Mini D7078E'
  .\run_high_load.ps1

Step 2: Immediately open PowerShell Window 2 (while Window 1 is running)
  cd 'C:\Users\snten\Desktop\bridge-between-computer\Mini D7078E'
  .\run_max_load.ps1

Both scripts will now run simultaneously!

OPTION 2: Sequential (safer but longer)

Run one, wait for it to complete, then run the other
Total time: ~50-70 minutes

OPTION 3: Staggered start

Start run_high_load.ps1
Wait 5 minutes (let it start)
Start run_max_load.ps1
This spreads the load increase

================================================================================
WHAT TO MONITOR
================================================================================

Open 4 browser tabs in AWS Console:

Tab 1: CloudWatch Dashboard
  └─ Watch CPU, RequestCount, HealthyHostCount in real-time

Tab 2: CloudWatch Alarms
  └─ Watch cpu-high-alarm-80percent state changes

Tab 3: ASG Activity
  └─ EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups > Activity tab
  └─ Watch rapid "Launching instance" events

Tab 4: EC2 Instances
  └─ EC2 > Instances
  └─ Watch instance count jump 1→2→3 quickly

Also monitor:
  • PowerShell windows showing request counts
  • Both scripts running simultaneously

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS
================================================================================

✓ CPU spike to 90%+ IMMEDIATELY
✓ Rapid alarm triggers (multiple times)
✓ Rapid instance launches
✓ All 3 instances running within 3-5 minutes
✓ Sustained 2500 RPS load
✓ Very impressive scaling demonstration
✓ Clear, undeniable proof of auto-scaling
✓ Stress test of maximum capacity

IMPRESSIVE FACTOR: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Maximum!)

================================================================================
COMPARISON
================================================================================

Run just run_high_load.ps1:
  ├─ Load: 500 RPS (Phase 3)
  ├─ CPU: 80%+
  ├─ Scaling: 1 → 2 → 3 (moderate speed)
  └─ Impressiveness: Good

Run just run_max_load.ps1:
  ├─ Load: 2000 RPS (Phase 3)
  ├─ CPU: 80%+ sustained
  ├─ Scaling: 1 → 2 → 3 (fast)
  └─ Impressiveness: Excellent

Run BOTH simultaneously:
  ├─ Load: 2500 RPS (Phase 3)
  ├─ CPU: 90%+ extreme
  ├─ Scaling: 1 → 2 → 3 (VERY FAST)
  └─ Impressiveness: MAXIMUM!

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For best results:

1. Start with just run_high_load.ps1 first
   └─ See how system responds to 500 RPS

2. Then try run_max_load.ps1 alone
   └─ See how system handles 2000 RPS

3. Finally, run BOTH simultaneously
   └─ See extreme stress test at 2500 RPS

This progression shows:
  ✓ Scaling behavior at different loads
  ✓ How system handles stress
  ✓ Maximum capacity demonstration

================================================================================
IF YOU WANT EVEN MORE
================================================================================

Create additional load generators:

Option 1: Run both scripts TWICE (4 total processes)
  Total load Phase 3: 5000 RPS!
  But this might break things

Option 2: Modify scripts to use more workers
  Could create 3000+ RPS easily
  But risk overwhelming ALB/instances

Option 3: Create custom script with even bigger load
  Could target 10000 RPS
  But likely not sustainable

Recommendation: 2500 RPS (both scripts) is probably the sweet spot!

================================================================================
GO FOR IT!
================================================================================

COMMAND TO RUN BOTH (in separate PowerShell windows):

Window 1:
.\run_high_load.ps1

Window 2:
.\run_max_load.ps1

Result: EXTREME auto-scaling demonstration! 🚀

Load: 2500 RPS
Duration: ~30 minutes (synchronized)
Proof: Obvious, rapid, impressive scaling!

Go for it - it will be VERY impressive! 💪
