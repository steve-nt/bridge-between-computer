DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP: CREATE SCALE-OUT POLICY WITH CLOUDWATCH ALARM
================================================================================

You are currently in the "Create dynamic scaling policy" form.
The form shows:
- Policy type: Step scaling ✓
- Scaling policy name: D7078E-MINI-PROJECT-GROUP35-SCALE-OUT-POLICY
- CloudWatch alarm: (empty dropdown)
- Take the action: Add
- Adjustment: (dropdown for capacity adjustment)
- Instance warmup: 300 seconds

================================================================================
STEP 1: RENAME THE POLICY (Optional but Clearer)
================================================================================

Current name: D7078E-MINI-PROJECT-GROUP35-SCALE-OUT-POLICY
Better name: scale-out-policy

1. Click in the "Scaling policy name" field
2. Select all the text (Ctrl+A)
3. Delete it
4. Type: scale-out-policy
5. Done - the field should now show "scale-out-policy"

================================================================================
STEP 2: CREATE THE CLOUDWATCH ALARM (The Main Part)
================================================================================

You need to create a CloudWatch alarm that will trigger this policy.

Current state: The "CloudWatch alarm" dropdown is EMPTY (blank field)

What to do:
1. Look for the blue text link below the CloudWatch alarm field
   It should say: "Create a CloudWatch alarm" (with a link icon)
2. Click on this blue link
3. This will open a NEW DIALOG to create the alarm

Once the alarm creation dialog opens, fill in these fields:

ALARM CREATION DIALOG - FIELDS TO FILL:
==========================================

Field 1: Alarm name
- Clear the field
- Type: cpu-high-alarm-80percent

Field 2: Alarm description (optional)
- Type: Triggers scale-out when CPU >= 80%

Field 3: Metric
- You should see a section to "Select a metric"
- Click on the metric selector
- Namespace: AWS/EC2
- Dimensions: Select "Auto Scaling Group"
- Metric name: CPUUtilization
- Statistic: Average
- Period: 60 seconds (1 minute)
- Click Next or Confirm

Field 4: Threshold
- Comparison operator: "Greater than or equal to"
- Threshold value: 80
- Datapoints to alarm: 2 (means 2 consecutive 1-minute periods = 2 minutes of high CPU)
- Click Next or Confirm

Field 5: Actions
- This may ask what to do when alarm triggers
- Select: "Send notification to" or "Trigger Auto Scaling Action"
- This should already be tied to your scaling policy
- Click Next or Confirm

Field 6: Final review
- Review all settings
- Click "Create alarm" button

================================================================================
STEP 3: BACK IN THE SCALING POLICY FORM
================================================================================

Once the alarm is created, the dialog closes and you return to the 
"Create dynamic scaling policy" form.

Now fill in the remaining fields:

Field 1: CloudWatch alarm
- The dropdown should now show the alarm you just created
- It may already be selected
- If not, click the dropdown and select: cpu-high-alarm-80percent

Field 2: Take the action
- Should already be set to "Add" (correct)
- If not, click and select "Add"

Field 3: Adjustment
- Click the dropdown showing "Percent of Group" or similar
- Select: "Capacity units" or "Change in capacity"
- This means we're adding/removing instances (not percentages)

Field 4: Adjustment value
- Type: 1
- This means: Add 1 instance when alarm triggers

Field 5: Instance warmup
- Should show: 300 seconds (correct - leave as is)
- This prevents rapid scaling during startup

================================================================================
STEP 4: CREATE THE POLICY
================================================================================

Once all fields are filled:
1. Look for a blue or orange button at the bottom: "Create"
2. Click it
3. The policy should be created
4. You'll see a confirmation message
5. You'll return to the ASG "Automatic scaling" tab

Expected result:
- "scale-out-policy" appears in the list of policies
- Status: Active

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If "Create a CloudWatch alarm" link is NOT visible:
- Scroll down in the form - it may be below the dropdown
- Try clicking inside the CloudWatch alarm dropdown field first
- Then look for the link to appear

If the form looks confusing:
- Take a screenshot and share it
- I can identify exactly which field is which

If you can't find the "Create dynamic scaling policy" button:
- Go to EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups
- Click: D7078E-MINI-PROJECT-GROUP35-ASG
- Go to: "Automatic scaling" tab
- Click: "Create dynamic scaling policy"

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU'RE CREATING
================================================================================

You're creating TWO things at once:
1. A CloudWatch Alarm: cpu-high-alarm-80percent
   - Monitors CPU
   - Triggers when CPU >= 80% for 2 minutes
   
2. A Scaling Policy: scale-out-policy
   - Listens to the alarm
   - When alarm triggers, add +1 instance

Together: When CPU is high for 2 minutes → alarm triggers → policy adds 1 instance
