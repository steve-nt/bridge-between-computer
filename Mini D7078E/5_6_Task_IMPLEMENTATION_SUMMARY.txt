WHAT YOU GET FOR TASK 5: ASG Activity Log & Failure Simulation
================================================================================

Complete instructions on how to:

✅ PRE-FLIGHT (2 minutes)
   - Verify 3 instances healthy
   - Verify all 3 "Healthy" in Target Group
   - Verify load generators running
   - Open CloudWatch dashboard
   - Take "before" screenshots

✅ TRIGGER FAILURE (2 minutes) 
   Choose one of 2 safe methods:
   
   METHOD A (RECOMMENDED): SSM Stress Command
   - Simple AWS CLI command
   - CPU stress for 120 seconds
   - Time-limited, safe, reversible
   - Ready-to-use command in COMMANDS_READY_TO_USE.md
   
   METHOD B (ENTERPRISE): AWS FIS Experiment
   - Fault Injection Simulator
   - Create experiment via console
   - Monitor and control CPU injection
   - More enterprise-grade

✅ MONITOR FAILURE & RECOVERY (7 minutes)
   Watch CloudWatch for:
   - CPU spike on stressed instance (90%+)
   - HealthyHostCount drop (3→2)
   - ASG Activity showing "Launching 1 instances"
   - New instance boot (Pending → Running)
   - New instance health check pass
   - HealthyHostCount recovery (2→3)
   - Old instance termination
   
   Timeline:
   - T+0-45s: Stress starts, CPU spikes, health check fails
   - T+45-60s: ASG launches replacement
   - T+60-120s: New instance boots and joins
   - T+120s+: Stress ends, old instance terminates, recovery complete
   Total recovery: ~4 minutes, fully automatic

✅ DOCUMENT TIMELINE (2 minutes)
   Record exact timestamps of:
   - When stress started
   - When health check failed
   - When ASG launched replacement
   - When new instance became healthy
   - Total recovery time

✅ SCREENSHOT COLLECTION (10-15 screenshots)
   - Before failure: 3 healthy instances
   - During failure: HealthyHostCount 3→2
   - During replacement: New instance launching
   - During recovery: HealthyHostCount 2→3
   - After recovery: All normalized
   - CloudWatch metrics showing full cycle
   
   All template details in TASK_5_6_QUICK_CHECKLIST.md

   Via Console: EC2 > ASG > Activity tab > Export to CSV

✅ CLOUDWATCH METRICS (2 exports)
   1. CPU Utilization metrics
      Command: aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics (CPU)
      Output: cloudwatch_cpu.json
