\section{Contributions}

Both group members of Group 35 contributed actively to the successful completion of this D7078E Cloud Security Mini Project assignment. 

\textbf{Member 1} undertook a comprehensive role spanning infrastructure design, implementation, and monitoring across Tasks 1-3, establishing the technical foundation for the entire project. Key responsibilities included designing and implementing the Python-based web application with three endpoints (/, /metrics, /burn), configuring the EC2 instance with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, creating the AMI template, architecting the complete infrastructure stack with Application Load Balancer across multiple availability zones, configuring the Auto Scaling Group with appropriate parameters (min=1, desired=1, max=3), implementing both scale-out and scale-in policies using AWS CLI with precise thresholds (80\% for scale-out, 30\% for scale-in), creating two CloudWatch alarms with correct evaluation periods, and designing a comprehensive monitoring dashboard with real-time widgets for CPU Utilization, RequestCount, HealthyHostCount, and UnhealthyHostCount. Additionally, Member 1 provided ongoing technical oversight and guidance throughout all project phases.

\textbf{Member 2} contributed to load testing and failure simulation activities across Tasks 4-5. This included developing the Python asyncio-based load generator (agent.py) with configurable workers and RPS parameters, creating the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment, executing load testing scenarios while monitoring CloudWatch metrics, and assisting with controlled failure simulation using AWS Systems Manager. 

Both members collaborated on Task 6 to systematically delete all AWS resources, verify complete cleanup, and produce the comprehensive final report with analysis and lessons learned.
