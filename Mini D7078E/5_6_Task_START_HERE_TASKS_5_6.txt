You asked: "How should we implement Tasks 5 & 6?"

This document tells you EXACTLY where to start and what to do.

================================================================================
YOUR MISSION
================================================================================

TASK 5: Demonstrate automatic failover
  ✓ Scale ASG to 3 instances (from Task 4 load)
  ✓ Trigger failure on one instance
  ✓ Observe automatic health check failure detection
  ✓ Watch ASG automatically launch replacement
  ✓ Document recovery with screenshots
  
TASK 6: Prove all actions are auditable
  ✓ Export SSM/FIS command logs
  ✓ Export CloudTrail audit trail
  ✓ Export ASG activity history
  ✓ Export CloudWatch metrics
  ✓ Create timeline with exact timestamps

Result: Complete lab report showing automatic resilience and auditability

Estimated time: 30-35 minutes total

COMMON QUESTIONS ANSWERED
================================================================================

Q: Do I need to do Tasks 1-4 first?
A: Yes, you need 3 running instances in ASG from Tasks 1-4. If you don't 
   have these, complete Tasks 1-4 first (using task_1.txt, task_2.txt, etc.)

Q: What if I only have 2 instances?
A: Tasks 5-6 work with 2 instances, but the exercise is designed for 3.
   Best to scale to 3 first using Task 4 load generators.

Q: Do I need to set up SSM first?
A: Yes, SSM role must be attached to instances before using SSM send-command.
   Follow SSM_SETUP_DETAILED.txt (30 minutes) to set up.
   If you already did this, you're ready!

Q: Can I use FIS instead of SSM?
A: Yes! Both work. SSM is simpler, FIS is more enterprise-grade.
   Follow IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS_GUIDE.md Method B for FIS setup.

Q: How long do Tasks 5 & 6 take?
A: Task 5 (execution): 15-20 minutes
   Task 6 (evidence): 10-15 minutes
   Total: 30-35 minutes
   Plus reading/understanding: 10-20 minutes first time

Q: What if health check doesn't fail?
A: Increase CPU stress load (change -l 90 to -l 95 in command)
   Or wait longer for health check to cycle
   See IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS_GUIDE.md Troubleshooting

Q: What if ASG doesn't launch replacement?
A: Check desired capacity is still 3 in ASG settings
   Check ASG activity log for error messages
   Check instance has sufficient IAM permissions
   See IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS_GUIDE.md Troubleshooting

Q: Where do I put my evidence files?
A: Create folder: Task_5_6_Evidence/
   Put all JSON files there
   Put all screenshots there
   Put timeline and analysis docs there
   Zip and submit to instructor

Q: How do I know recovery is complete?
A: HealthyHostCount returns to 3 and stays there
   CPU normalizes to pre-failure levels
   RequestCount returns to pre-failure rates
   All 3 instances show "Healthy" in Target Group
   Old stressed instance is completely terminated
