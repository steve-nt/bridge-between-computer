\section{Contributions}

Both group members of Group 35 contributed equally to the successful completion of this D7078E Cloud Security Mini Project assignment. Each member independently implemented and executed the complete lab environment (Tasks 1-5) on their respective AWS accounts, including web application deployment, infrastructure configuration, Auto Scaling Group setup, CloudWatch monitoring, and failure simulation testing.

Both members collaborated closely during the final phase to consolidate findings, analyze results, and produce the comprehensive final report documenting the lab execution, performance metrics, observations, and lessons learned.
