ARE RANDOM SEEDS AND DEVICE SELECTION NECESSARY?
================================================================================

# Set seed for reproducibility
torch.manual_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

# Set device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

================================================================================
SECTION 1: Random Seeds [OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED]
================================================================================

torch.manual_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

NECESSITY: ⚠️ OPTIONAL (not required for code to run)

WHY YOU MIGHT INCLUDE THEM:
  ✓ Reproducibility: Get SAME results every time you run the code
  ✓ Debugging: Easier to debug when results are consistent
  ✓ Academic/Research: Required for published papers
  ✓ Comparison: Compare algorithms fairly with same initial conditions

WHY YOU MIGHT SKIP THEM:
  ✗ Normal ML behavior: Genetic algorithms are stochastic (random-based)
  ✗ Different seeds = different but equally valid results
  ✗ Production code: Usually want randomness for variety

IN OUR CASE (One-Pixel Attack):
  → RECOMMENDED to INCLUDE
  → Reason: Each run will show similar attack behavior
  → Makes debugging easier if something goes wrong
  → Better for scientific reports (reproducible results)

WHAT CHANGES IF YOU REMOVE SEEDS:
  Without seeds:
    Run 1: Success rate 65%, Average iterations 85
    Run 2: Success rate 72%, Average iterations 92
    Run 3: Success rate 68%, Average iterations 88
    
  With seeds (seed=42):
    Run 1: Success rate 68%, Average iterations 87
    Run 2: Success rate 68%, Average iterations 87
    Run 3: Success rate 68%, Average iterations 87

================================================================================
SECTION 2: Device Selection [NECESSARY ✓]
================================================================================

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

NECESSITY: ✅ NECESSARY (code will fail without this)

WHY IT'S ESSENTIAL:
  ✓ Tell PyTorch WHERE to run computations
  ✓ GPU (CUDA) is ~100x faster than CPU for neural networks
  ✓ Without specifying device, code may fail when moving tensors

WHAT HAPPENS:
  
  With device specification:
    model = model.to(device)           ← Moves model to GPU/CPU
    images = images.to(device)         ← Moves data to GPU/CPU
    Result: Everything runs on same device ✓
  
  Without device specification:
    Error: Tensor device mismatch
    "Expected all tensors to be on the same device"

HOW IT WORKS:
  
  if torch.cuda.is_available():
    → Uses GPU (CUDA) - Fast! ⚡
    → device = "cuda"
    → Forward pass: ~0.1 seconds per image
  else:
    → Falls back to CPU - Slow but works 🐢
    → device = "cpu"
    → Forward pass: ~1-5 seconds per image
  
  In your case:
    You have GPU available (cu128 = CUDA 12.8)
    → device will be "cuda"
    → 10 images will take ~10 seconds (GPU)
    → Without GPU would take ~50-100 seconds (CPU)

================================================================================
SECTION 3: Print Statement [OPTIONAL BUT HELPFUL]
================================================================================

print(f"Using device: {device}")

NECESSITY: ⚠️ OPTIONAL (nice to have)

WHY INCLUDE IT:
  ✓ Debugging: Know if GPU is actually being used
  ✓ Transparency: User sees what device is active
  ✓ Performance: Helps identify slow runs (CPU vs GPU)

OUTPUT:
  Using device: cuda   ← GPU is being used (fast)
  OR
  Using device: cpu    ← CPU is being used (slow)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR PROJECT
================================================================================

INCLUDE ALL THREE?
  → YES, I recommend including them all
  
BREAKDOWN:
  torch.manual_seed(42)        → YES (reproducibility)
  np.random.seed(42)           → YES (reproducibility)
  device selection             → YES (REQUIRED)
  print device                 → YES (helpful debugging)

WHAT TO DO:
  → Keep these lines in Cell 1
  → They don't hurt, improve reproducibility, and improve debugging
  → Standard practice in ML projects

IF TIME-CONSTRAINED:
  → Only REQUIRED: device assignment
  → Nice to have: seeds + print
  → Can remove seeds if you want different results each run

SUMMARY TABLE
================================================================================

Component                   | Required | Recommended | Impact
---------------------------|----------|-------------|------------------
torch.manual_seed(42)       | No       | Yes         | Reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)          | No       | Yes         | Reproducibility
device selection            | YES ✓    | YES ✓       | Code won't work without
print(f"Using device: ...")  | No       | Yes         | Debugging info

================================================================================
FINAL ANSWER
================================================================================

These lines are NOT strictly necessary for the code to RUN, but:

1. SEEDS: Highly recommended for reproducibility (keep them)
2. DEVICE: Absolutely necessary (keep it)
3. PRINT: Helpful for debugging (keep it)

RECOMMENDATION: Keep all of them. They follow best practices in ML development.
