TASK 3: Create 3 Security Groups with Strict Isolation Rules
==============================================================

Objective:
Configure three security groups to enforce strict network isolation between EC2 instances.

Security Groups Created:

1. SG-WEB (Web Application Server)
   Inbound Rules:
   - HTTPS (443) from 0.0.0.0/0 (external access)
   - SSH (22) from 203.0.113.55/32 (admin only)
   
   Outbound Rules:
   - Allow all (default)
   
   Assigned to: WEB-SERVER (i-09b2da9995b961dc9)

2. SG-DB (Database Server)
   Inbound Rules:
   - SSH (22) from 203.0.113.55/32 (admin only)
   - NO MySQL (3306)
   - NO traffic from other EC2 instances
   
   Outbound Rules:
   - Allow all (default)
   
   Assigned to: DB-SERVER (i-081af8cc4ec64625e)

3. SG-STORAGE (Storage/API Server)
   Inbound Rules:
   - NO inbound traffic from EC2 instances
   - API Gateway access handled externally
   
   Outbound Rules:
   - Allow all (for S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail APIs)
   
   Assigned to: STORAGE-SERVER (i-0f8da4bee4b8ff2ba)

Isolation Enforced:
- ❌ Web Server ↔ DB Server (blocked)
- ❌ Web Server ↔ Storage Server (blocked)
- ❌ DB Server ↔ Storage Server (blocked)
- ✅ External users → Web Server (HTTPS only)
- ✅ Admin → DB Server (SSH only)

Status: COMPLETED ✓
