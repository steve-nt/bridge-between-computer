TASK 5: Create IAM Role for Storage Server (EC2 #3)
===================================================

Objective:
Create an IAM role that grants the Storage Server least-privilege access to the S3 bucket.
This enforces identity-layer access control alongside network-layer security groups.

IAM Role Details:

Role Name: Storage-Server-IAM-Role
Description: IAM role for Storage Server to access S3 bucket
Trust Policy: Allows EC2 instances (ec2.amazonaws.com) to assume this role
Attached Policy: AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess (AWS Managed Policy)

Policy Permissions:
- s3:GetObject - Read objects from S3 bucket
- s3:ListBucket - List contents of S3 bucket
- Resource ARN: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-d7078e-lab3-group35
- Resource ARN: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-d7078e-lab3-group35/*

Role Attachment:
- Attached to: STORAGE-SERVER-D7078E-Lab3 (i-0f8da4bee4b8ff2ba)
- Instance can now assume this role and access S3
- Access verified through instance IAM metadata service

Trust Policy (JSON):
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "ec2.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

Security Principles Applied:
1. Least Privilege - Role only has read access to specific S3 bucket
2. Service Principal - Only EC2 service can assume this role
3. Resource Restriction - Limited to specific S3 bucket and objects

Status: COMPLETED ✓

Next Task: Task 6 - Create API Gateway to Access S3 Files
