AWS Cloud Security Lab 3: Multi-Tier Isolation
===============================================

This document contains confidential information about the multi-tier architecture
implemented in the D7078E Cloud Security Lab.

Lab Overview:
- Three isolated EC2 instances deployed
- Strict security group rules enforce network isolation
- Database server restricted to admin SSH access only
- Web application server accessible via HTTPS only
- Storage server uses API Gateway for controlled access

Security Principles Applied:
1. Least Privilege Access - Each instance has minimal required permissions
2. Network Isolation - EC2 instances cannot communicate directly
3. Secure Channels - All data flows through HTTPS and IAM-controlled APIs
4. Monitoring & Logging - CloudWatch and CloudTrail track all activities
5. Defense in Depth - Multiple layers of security controls

Files in this bucket are protected by IAM policies and can only be accessed
through the API Gateway endpoint via the Storage Server instance.
