                    MORE OR LESS - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
              A JavaScript Tutorial for Beginner Programmers (Age 16+)
================================================================================

🎯 ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

In this assignment, you'll be creating four simple functions that perform basic
arithmetic operations. Think of these functions as tiny calculators, each with
a specific job to do. This is your first step toward understanding how functions
work and how they can make your code reusable and organized.

What you'll learn:
  • How to define functions in JavaScript
  • How function parameters (arguments) work
  • How to return values from functions
  • The difference between operations on single values vs. multiple values


📚 KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND
================================================================================

1. WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
   ────────────────────
   A function is like a machine in a factory. You feed it some input (called
   arguments or parameters), it processes that input according to its
   instructions, and then it gives you an output (the return value).

   Think of it this way:
   - A vending machine is a function:
     INPUT: money + button press (your arguments)
     PROCESS: the machine counts money and picks a snack (the function body)
     OUTPUT: a snack falls out (the return value)

   In JavaScript, a basic function looks like this:
   
   function nameOfFunction(argument1, argument2) {
       // code goes here
       return result;
   }


2. PARAMETERS vs. ARGUMENTS
   ────────────────────────
   These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but here's the difference:
   
   • PARAMETERS: the names you define when creating the function
   • ARGUMENTS: the actual values you pass when calling the function
   
   Example:
   function add(a, b) {    // 'a' and 'b' are PARAMETERS
       return a + b;
   }
   
   add(5, 3);              // '5' and '3' are ARGUMENTS


3. THE RETURN STATEMENT
   ────────────────────
   The 'return' keyword is how you send a value back from your function.
   Without it, your function will return 'undefined' (basically nothing).
   
   Once a return statement is hit, the function stops executing immediately.
   
   Example:
   function double(number) {
       return number * 2;  // This value goes back to whoever called the function
   }
   
   let result = double(5);
   console.log(result);    // prints: 10


4. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
   ────────────────────
   These are the basic math symbols you'll be using:
   
   +  Addition:      5 + 3 = 8
   -  Subtraction:   5 - 3 = 2
   *  Multiplication: 5 * 3 = 15
   /  Division:      6 / 2 = 3


🔧 BREAKING DOWN THE ASSIGNMENT
================================================================================

Now let's look at each function you need to create:


FUNCTION 1: more()
──────────────────
Purpose: Takes a number and adds 1 to it

Structure:
  • Takes 1 parameter: the number to increase
  • Adds 1 to that number
  • Returns the new value
  
Think of it as: "I want to go up by one level"

Example usage:
  more(5)   →  6
  more(10)  →  11
  more(-1)  →  0


FUNCTION 2: less()
──────────────────
Purpose: Takes a number and subtracts 1 from it

Structure:
  • Takes 1 parameter: the number to decrease
  • Subtracts 1 from that number
  • Returns the new value
  
Think of it as: "I want to go down by one level"

Example usage:
  less(5)   →  4
  less(10)  →  9
  less(-1)  →  -2


FUNCTION 3: add()
──────────────────
Purpose: Takes two numbers and adds them together

Structure:
  • Takes 2 parameters: the two numbers to add
  • Adds them together
  • Returns the sum
  
Think of it as: "Combine two amounts"

Example usage:
  add(5, 3)   →  8
  add(10, 20) →  30
  add(-5, 5)  →  0


FUNCTION 4: sub()
──────────────────
Purpose: Takes two numbers and subtracts the second from the first

Structure:
  • Takes 2 parameters: the first number (the one we're subtracting from)
                        and the second number (the one we're subtracting)
  • Subtracts the second from the first
  • Returns the difference
  
Think of it as: "How much more is the first number than the second?"

⚠️  IMPORTANT: The order matters!
  sub(10, 3) → 7  (10 minus 3)
  sub(3, 10) → -7 (3 minus 10)

Example usage:
  sub(10, 3)  →  7
  sub(5, 8)   →  -3
  sub(0, 5)   →  -5


💻 COMPLETE JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

// FUNCTION 1: more
// Purpose: Increases a number by 1
// Parameters: num - the number to increase
// Returns: the number increased by 1
function more(num) {
    return num + 1;
}


// FUNCTION 2: less
// Purpose: Decreases a number by 1
// Parameters: num - the number to decrease
// Returns: the number decreased by 1
function less(num) {
    return num - 1;
}


// FUNCTION 3: add
// Purpose: Adds two numbers together
// Parameters: num1 - the first number
//             num2 - the second number
// Returns: the sum of num1 and num2
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}


// FUNCTION 4: sub
// Purpose: Subtracts the second number from the first number
// Parameters: num1 - the number to subtract from (the starting amount)
//             num2 - the number to subtract (the amount being taken away)
// Returns: the difference (num1 minus num2)
function sub(num1, num2) {
    return num1 - num2;
}


🧪 HOW TO TEST YOUR FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

You can test your functions by calling them and checking the results. Here are
some test cases you can try in your browser console or Node.js:

// Testing more()
console.log(more(5));       // Should print: 6
console.log(more(0));       // Should print: 1
console.log(more(-10));     // Should print: -9

// Testing less()
console.log(less(5));       // Should print: 4
console.log(less(0));       // Should print: -1
console.log(less(-10));     // Should print: -11

// Testing add()
console.log(add(5, 3));     // Should print: 8
console.log(add(-5, 5));    // Should print: 0
console.log(add(100, 200)); // Should print: 300

// Testing sub()
console.log(sub(10, 3));    // Should print: 7
console.log(sub(5, 8));     // Should print: -3
console.log(sub(0, 5));     // Should print: -5


✨ KEY TAKEAWAYS
================================================================================

1. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
2. Parameters are placeholders for values you'll provide later
3. The return statement sends a value back from the function
4. Parameter order matters! sub(10, 3) is different from sub(3, 10)
5. Simple functions like these are building blocks for more complex programs


🔍 FURTHER LEARNING - KEYWORDS & TOPICS TO EXPLORE
================================================================================

To deepen your understanding of what you've learned, search for these topics:

• "JavaScript Functions" - the fundamentals
• "Function Parameters and Arguments" - the difference and how they work
• "Return Statement" - how functions send values back
• "Arrow Functions" - a newer, shorter way to write functions (ES6)
• "Function Scope" - what variables can be accessed from where
• "Pure Functions" - functions that don't have side effects
• "Function Naming Conventions" - how to name your functions properly
• "DRY Principle" (Don't Repeat Yourself) - why functions matter
• "console.log() for Debugging" - how to print values for testing


💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

1. Start simple: These are very basic functions, and that's perfect for
   learning. Master the basics before moving to complex stuff.

2. Test frequently: After you write each function, test it immediately.
   Don't write all four and then test.

3. Use console.log(): Print out your results to make sure they match
   what you expect.

4. Read error messages: If something breaks, the error message usually
   tells you what's wrong. Learn to read them!

5. Understand before memorizing: Don't just copy-paste code. Make sure
   you understand why it works.

6. Practice variations: Once you've created these, try variations like:
   - A function that adds 2 instead of 1
   - A function that multiplies by 2
   - A function that adds three numbers instead of two


🎓 ABOUT PARAMETERS
================================================================================

Each function needs the EXACT number of parameters specified. This is important:

✗ WRONG: function more() { ... }           // Missing the parameter
✓ RIGHT: function more(num) { ... }       // Has the required parameter

✗ WRONG: function add(a) { ... }          // Only has 1 parameter, needs 2
✓ RIGHT: function add(a, b) { ... }      // Has both required parameters

JavaScript is flexible, but being precise makes your code clearer and more
reliable.


🚀 NEXT STEPS AFTER THIS ASSIGNMENT
================================================================================

Once you've mastered these simple functions, you'll be ready to learn:

• Function expressions and arrow functions
• Objects and methods (functions inside objects)
• Higher-order functions (functions that work with other functions)
• Callbacks and asynchronous JavaScript
• Building real applications with functions


================================================================================
                              GOOD LUCK! 🎉
================================================================================

Remember: Every expert programmer started exactly where you are now. These
simple functions are the foundation of everything you'll build in JavaScript.
Take your time, understand each part, and celebrate when it works!

If you get stuck:
1. Re-read this guide
