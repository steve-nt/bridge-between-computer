================================================================================
WHAT WILL HAPPEN?
================================================================================

When you run task-2-1-setup.sh:
   ✓ Creates a security group (firewall)
   ✓ Creates an IAM policy (permissions)
   ✓ Creates an IAM role (identity)
   ✓ Creates an S3 bucket (cloud storage)
   ✓ Launches an EC2 instance (virtual computer)
   ✓ You can SSH into it
   ✓ Saves configuration to lab2-config.txt

When you run Java programs:
   ✓ Creates S3 buckets in 3 regions
   ✓ Uploads test files
   ✓ Downloads test files
   ✓ Measures latency (speed)
   ✓ Shows results in a table

When you write the lab report:
   ✓ Describe what you did
   ✓ Answer reflection questions
   ✓ Include screenshots
   ✓ Include code listings
   ✓ Analyze results
   ✓ Discuss security concepts
   ✓ 15-25 pages total

================================================================================
IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU START
================================================================================

AWS ACCOUNT:
   ✓ You MUST have a valid AWS account
   ✓ You MUST have AWS credentials configured
   ✓ This lab will incur small costs (~$0.05-0.10)
   ✓ You MUST clean up resources when done

AWS CREDENTIALS:
   ✓ Run: aws configure
   ✓ Enter your Access Key ID
   ✓ Enter your Secret Access Key
   ✓ Verify: aws sts get-caller-identity
   ✓ Keep credentials SAFE and SECRET
   ✓ Never commit credentials to Git!

SAFETY:
   ✓ Cleanup script will delete all resources
   ✓ Make sure to run cleanup when done
   ✓ This avoids unwanted AWS charges
   ✓ The script will ask for confirmation

TIMING:
   ✓ Total lab time: 4-6 hours
   ✓ Task 2.1: 45 minutes
   ✓ Task 2.2: 1 hour
   ✓ Report: 3-5 hours

================================================================================
