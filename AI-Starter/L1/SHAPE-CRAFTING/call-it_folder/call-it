Context
Congratulations! You've created the very first foundation for your robot and witnessed its appearance in the Digital World, your browser. However, it's still a tiny seed of the marvelous thing it could become. Be patient; there's still some work to do.

Directions
First, instead of writing down what things are (you're not writing the word 'hand' on your hand, are you?), we'll identify them semantically using the very practical id attribute. This id must be a unique identifier on your webpage, allowing you to target your element when needed. You can think of it like your name and surname; this is what identifies you to others, and when someone calls you by your name, you respond.

Instructions
Let's identify the 3 elements we have so far:

In each section, remove the text content from inside the tag and instead set that text as the value of the id attribute of the corresponding section tag.

Example transformation:

<!-- From this: -->
<section>face</section>

<!-- To this: -->
<section id="face"></section>
Run your code in the editor preview:

Don't see anything? Don't panic!

The sections are now empty (no visible text), but they still exist in your HTML structure. Inspect the HTML that has been created using your browser inspector tool. If you've done it correctly, you should see the 3 sections inside the body, each with its respective id attribute set in your HTML structure.

Code examples
To set the id of a div tag to "my-lil-div":

<div id="my-lil-div"></div>
