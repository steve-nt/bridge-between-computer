Context
To build your robot companion, you first need to create its skeleton, and that's where HTML comes into play. HTML serves as the blueprint that defines the structure of your robot, giving it shape and form. With HTML, you'll construct the framework that holds all your creative ideas together. Ready to start building? Let's dive in and lay the foundation for your robot buddy!

Throughout this quest, the principle is to iterate on your code: after completing an exercise, copy and paste your code to use it in the next one.

Remember to remove the comment from the code editor (the line starting with //) in all incoming exercises, and add your solution in its place. Answers that still contain the comment will not be accepted.

File Naming
Your HTML file is called in the code editor as follows: name-of-the-exercise.html

Your CSS file is called in the code editor as follows: name-of-the-exercise.css

Instructions
Ready? Let's code!

The first step in your quest is to shape your robot. To do this, you need to complete two tasks:

Customize the <head> tag.

Customize the <title> tag.

To start a project, certain elements must be declared in the HTML file. These elements are not visible on the page but are essential for functionality.

The <head> Section:
Choose a power for your robot from the following list and set it as the <title>:

invisibility

light-speed

super-strength

advanced-healing

mind-link

The <body> Section:
This section contains the content of your webpage. In our case, it represents your entire robot structure. Define the skeleton of your robot by organizing it into three main sections: the face, the upper body, and the lower body. Inside the <body> tag of your HTML file, create three divisions using <section> tags, and place the following text content inside each one: face, upper-body, lower-body.

Don't forget to press 'Render' to refresh the display

Hint: Remember to include the <head> and <body> tags! Although browsers may automatically insert them if omitted, it's better practice to explicitly add them for improved structure and readability.

Code Examples
To create a section tag with hello as the text content inside the body:

<body>
  <section>hello</section>
</body>
