Context
Congratulations! You've outlined the overall structure of your robot friend. Now it's time to bring it to life by adding its essential components. Let's equip your robot with its vital organs! To achieve this, we'll introduce the concept of nesting elements within others. This approach will allow you to build a fully functional robot, one step at a time.

Don't be intimidated by the complexity of the tasks. Break them down into smaller, manageable steps.

Instructions
Currently, your <body> contains a single layer: face, upper-body, and lower-body are all at the same level. However, as you know, a face includes two eyes, a nose, and a mouth—and within that mouth, there's a tongue, and so on. Any element can serve as a container for other elements.

Task 1
Replace your existing empty sections with nested elements to create different layers of robot parts. Update your HTML structure to match the following:

<section id="face">
  <div id="eyes">
    <p id="eye-left"></p>
    <p id="eye-right"></p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="upper-body">
  <div id="arm-left"></div>
  <div id="torso"></div>
  <div id="arm-right"></div>
</section>

<section id="lower-body">
  <div id="leg-left"></div>
  <div id="leg-right"></div>
</section>
Remember to change the file name in your <link> tag to match your new CSS file name.

Task 2
Update your CSS file by adding the following properties to your existing section selector: set display to flex and justify-content to center. This will turn the section elements into flex containers, centering the elements inside them.

Task 3
Add the following CSS rules to your existing CSS file to style the newly added nested elements:

div,
p {
  border: solid 1px black;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 0;
  border-radius: 30px;
}

#face {
  align-items: center;
}

#eyes {
  display: flex;
  background-color: yellow;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: 50px;
  width: 200px;
}

#torso {
  width: 200px;
  background-color: violet;
}
Code examples
Here's an example of nesting multiple elements:

<div id="first-element">
  <span id="second-element"></span>
  <div id="third-element">
    <p id="fourth-element"></p>
  </div>
</div>
Expected output
Here's what you should see in the browser: Expected Output

Your robot should display:

Face section: Contains two eyes (black-bordered circles) within a yellow eye container, centered in the face

Upper body section: Shows left arm, torso (purple/violet background), and right arm arranged horizontally

Lower body section: Displays two legs side by side

From now on, you can customize the background-color of the following sections in the CSS code to match your theme:
#face
#upper-body
#lower-body
Not sure which colors are available? This list might help.
