Context
Great work so far! Now you'll see how JavaScript can make your robot interactive. In this exercise, you'll use JavaScript to close your robot's left eye, giving you a first taste of how JavaScript controls HTML elements.

Follow the instructions, ask your peers if you get stuck, and pay attention to every hint!

Instructions
Your JS file is named first-move.js. Copy your last HTML submission into the first-move.html file.

First, add this new class to your class-it.css file:

.eye-closed {
  height: 4px;
  padding: 0 5px;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
Task 1
Link a JS script to your HTML file before the closing </body> tag.

Hint: Place the script tag just before </body> to ensure the HTML is loaded before the JavaScript runs.

Task 2
In your JavaScript file, target the left eye of your robot. Use the getElementById method to select the HTML element with the id eye-left.

Task 3
After targeting the eye element, perform these two actions:

Set its style to change its background color to black

Add the eye-closed class to the element using the classList.add() method

This will close the left eye by changing both its color and shape.

Code Examples
Example 1
To target the nose HTML element by its id using getElementById:

In the HTML file:

<!-- HTML -->
<div id="nose"></div>
In the JS file:

const nose = document.getElementById("nose");
Example 2
To add a CSS class to an element:

.nose-red {
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
nose.classList.add("nose-red");
Example 3
To change the background color of an element using inline styles:

nose.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
Expected Output
By the way, do you like the new background color you chose earlier? Me too.
To personalize your robot even more, feel free to adjust the inclination of its arms to reflect the personality you've envisioned!
Adding a rotation to the arm class is a great way to achieve this.

This is what you should see in the browser:
Expected Output

Your robot should display with the left eye closed (appears as a thin black line) while the right eye remains open and red.
