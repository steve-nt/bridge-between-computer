Context
Imagine your favorite robot friend with all its cool features: a brand, model, and battery level.

In JavaScript, we use objects to group these properties together, making it easy to manage and modify our robot's settings. Let's see how we can add, change, or remove properties in a JavaScript object to make our robot even cooler!

AI-Powered Learning Techniques
Contextual Learning Technique: This strategy asks AI to create real-world scenarios and practical examples that show why and when you would use specific programming concepts. Instead of just learning syntax, you understand the purpose and application of object manipulation in actual situations.

Find examples across the subject and ask AI to create realistic scenarios! ;)

Concepts
Modifying Objects
Let's start with a robot object:

const robot = {
  brand: "TechBot",
  batteryLevel: 50,
};
Adding a New Property
Give your robot a model:

robot.model = "RX-78";
Changing a Property Value
Boost your robot's battery:

robot.batteryLevel = 75;
You can also perform calculations when modifying:

robot.batteryLevel = robot.batteryLevel + 10; // Add 10 to current battery level
Removing a Property
Remove a property completely:

delete robot.code; // Completely removes the 'code' property
Combining Properties
You can create new properties using existing ones:

robot.fullName = robot.brand + " " + robot.model; // "TechBot RX-78"
Prompt example:
"I'm learning to modify JavaScript objects. Can you create 3 realistic scenarios where I would need to add, change, or remove properties from objects? Use examples like managing a user profile, updating game character stats, or tracking inventory items."

Instructions
Task 1:
A robot object has been provided with brand and batteryLevel properties. Modify this object by:

Add a model property with the string value 'RX-78'

Add a fullName property that combines the brand and model values with a space in between

Add 10 to the existing batteryLevel property (don't just set it to a number, actually add 10 to whatever value is already there)

NOTE: Do not redeclare the provided object, as this will cause your solution to fail the tests.

Task 2:
Let's move away from objects a bit and discover a concept we will use later: Duplicating a String with Placeholders!

A variable called sentence has been provided for you. Declare a variable duplicate that:

Takes the sentence value

Repeats it twice, separated by a comma and space

Adds an exclamation mark at the end

For example, if sentence contains "Hello there", your duplicate should contain "Hello there, Hello there!"

Expected format:

let duplicate = // your solution using the sentence variable
What a good occasion to apply what you learned about using generative AI and documentation to understand duplicating a string with placeholders! Now you are capable of finding this information everywhere ;)
