Context
Your robot will need to start executing custom tasks, and to do that, you'll need to program its functions. Functions are like commands that tell the robot exactly what to do.

You can create your own functions to give your robot unique abilities and make it more efficient!

AI-Powered Learning Techniques
Reflective Practice Technique: This type of prompt asks AI to help you think about what you've learned and connect new concepts to previous knowledge. Use this technique to deepen understanding by exploring how functions relate to other programming concepts you know.

Concepts
Function Calls (Review)
Remember calling built-in functions?

console.log("Hello There!"); // Calling the console.log function
Now we'll learn to create our own functions!

Declaring a Function
Create your own function using arrow function syntax:

let myFirstFunction = () => {
  console.log("Robot is now active!");
};
Breaking it down:

let myFirstFunction - declares a variable to store the function

= () => - arrow function syntax (empty parentheses for no arguments)

{} - curly braces contain the function's instructions

Calling Your Function
Use parentheses to call your function:

myFirstFunction(); // Output: "Robot is now active!"
Functions with Instructions
Put any code inside the function's curly braces:

let greetRobot = () => {
  console.log("Hello, I am a robot!");
  console.log("Ready for commands!");
};

greetRobot(); // Runs both console.log statements
Prompt example:
"I just learned about creating functions in JavaScript. Help me reflect on how functions relate to variables and console.log statements I learned earlier. What are the benefits of putting code inside functions versus writing it directly?"

Instructions
Task 1:
Create two functions that simulate a conversation between a robot and its creator:

Declare a function named ask that logs the message: 'What is my purpose?'

Declare a function named reply that logs the message: 'You pass butter.'

Call the ask function

Call the reply function
