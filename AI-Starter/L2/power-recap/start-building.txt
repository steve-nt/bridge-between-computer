Context
Welcome back! Let's start your journey to unlock the Gate of Knowledge for your robot.

Your mission is to build the Knowledge Gate chatbot, a learning portal where your robot can ask for book recommendations on any topic while learning more about Earth.

Today, you will code the user interface. You will add the brain later!

The instructions guide you toward the result. Don't hesitate to ask for help from your peers. From now on, you will discover new concepts. The best way to understand them is by quickly moving to the instructions after using the learning prompts.

Using AI Tools for Learning
Objective: Use your AI assistant tools (Amazon Q, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) to support your learning while building your project. Here is a video to help you get started.

Concepts
Flexbox: Your UI Superpower
Flexbox is a powerful tool in CSS that helps you neatly arrange items on your webpage. It makes stacking, spacing, and aligning elements simple, whether you're placing them in rows or columns, ensuring your layout always looks good.

Example:

#chatbox {
  display: flex; /* Enables Flexbox for inner elements */
  flex-direction: column; /* Stacks messages, input, and button vertically */
}
This stacks the children of #chatbox vertically.

Prompt to Learn More:
"As a beginner, explain to me how to stack items vertically using Flexbox."

Box Model: Spacing and Layout
What is px?
px means pixel, the smallest visible unit on a screen. It's used to define fixed sizes in CSS.

padding: 10px; means 10 pixels of space inside the element.

margin: 10px; means 10 pixels of space outside the element (all four sides unless specified otherwise).

Remember that border-radius defines the curve of the element's corners.

Example:

.message {
  padding: 10px 15px; /* Internal spacing for text bubbles */
  margin: 5px 0; /* Vertical spacing between messages */
  border-radius: 5px; /* Smooth, rounded bubble edges */
}
Prompt to Learn More:
"As a beginner, explain to me the difference between margin and padding in CSS."

Hint: Remember that you learn fully by practicing. Start the project, and you will learn more!

Instructions
For this project, you don't need to create any JavaScript file since that will be the next step in the next project. This is a UI-only project focused on layout and styling.

Section 1 - HTML Setup
Objective: Create a basic HTML structure for your chatbot.

Tasks:

Set up project structure:

Create a folder called start-building inside your workspace folder, and open it in VSCode.

Create a new file inside it called: knowledge-gate.html.

Create base HTML structure:

Begin by creating your base HTML structure.

Make sure to include the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the very top.

You can quickly scaffold a complete HTML5 structure in VSCode using Emmet:

Type ! (exclamation mark) in your HTML file and press Tab — this will auto-generate the boilerplate HTML, including <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

Inside the <head> tag, add a title element with the text "My Gate Of Knowledge".

Add a link element to connect your CSS file "knowledge-gate.css" to your HTML file.

Add chatbot HTML structure:

Inside the <body> tag, paste this HTML structure for your chatbot, as shown below:

<div id="chatbot-container">
  <h1>Knowledge Gate</h1>
  <div id="chatbox">
    <div id="messages"></div>
    <div id="input-area">
      <input
        type="text"
        id="user-input"
        placeholder="Type your message..."
      />
      <button id="send-button">Send</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Hint: Use the Live Preview extension to see the progress of your work. You can follow this video.

Understand the structure:

Here is the explanation of this structure:

Step 1: The <div> with the ID chatbot-container is the outer wrapper that holds your entire chatbot interface.

Step 2: The <div> with the ID chatbox will act as the main chat area where you'll place all the components.

Step 3: Inside #chatbox, the <div> with the ID messages is where all your user and bot messages will appear.

Step 4: Also inside #chatbox, there is a <div> with an id of input-area containing the <input> element with the ID user-input where users will type their messages.

Step 5: Inside #input-area, there is a <button> element with the ID send-button that allows users to submit messages.

Section 2 - CSS Styling

Tasks:

Style the body element (main page background):

Create a file called knowledge-gate.css.

Inside it, select your body element and set a font-family of your choice. For example, you can use 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif' for a clean, modern text font.

Center the layout using Flexbox by setting display to flex, justify-content to center, and align-items to center.
