Abstract. The integration of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) within CyberPhysical Systems (CPS) is reshaping critical infrastructure, driving improvements in efficiency, automation,
and agile decision-making. However, this integration introduces significant cybersecurity challenges due to
fundamental differences in priorities, protocols, and governance models. While IT systems emphasize data
confidentiality and rapid updates, OT systems prioritize availability, reliability, and safety—often relying
on legacy infrastructure less-equipped to handle modern threats. This paper explores the multifaceted
challenges in securing IT-OT convergence within CPS, with a particular focus on critical infrastructure
sectors such as energy, water, transportation, and manufacturing. The policy and regulatory gaps that hinder
unified security strategies are analysed. The architectural models that support secure interoperability are
examined, and key implementation challenges including segmentation, legacy system integration, and threat
modelling are identified. A literature review of contemporary frameworks and case studies reveals a
fragmented approach to security, with a need for further standardization, governance harmonization, and
real-time risk assessment tools. This paper outlines general guidelines and checkpoints aligned of existing
frameworks for a layered, defense-in-depth strategy aligned with zero-trust principles, supported by policy
recommendations and architectural guidelines tailored to critical infrastructure protection. The findings aim
to assist policymakers, engineers, and security professionals in building resilient and adaptive CPS
environments to mitigate evolving cyber threats.
1 Introduction
The rapid digital transformation of industrial
environments has led to the Information Technology
(IT) and Operational Technology (OT) convergence
across Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), particularly in
vital infrastructure domains like energy, water,
transportation, and manufacturing. Traditionally, IT
systems have operated in corporate domains focused on
data processing, communication, and cybersecurity,
while OT systems have been designed to control and
monitor physical processes with an emphasis on
availability, safety, and real-time performance.
Significant advantages, such as increased automation,
remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, and
increased operational efficiency, result from the
convergence of these two disciplines. However, because
IT and OT systems have different features, threat
landscapes, and design philosophies, this integration
also brings with it complicated cybersecurity threats. [1]
Critical infrastructures are particularly vulnerable to
the implications of IT-OT convergence. Given that
traditional OT systems, which were typically developed
without cybersecurity as a core consideration, are
increasingly connected to enterprise IT networks and the

internet, the attack surface expands exponentially. This
has been evidenced by numerous high-profile
cyberattacks such as the Stuxnet worm, Colonial
Pipeline breach, and Triton malware, which exploited
weak links between IT and OT layers. Such incidents
underscore the urgent need for robust, sector-specific
cybersecurity strategies that bridge the policy,
architecture, and implementation gaps between these
domains.
Despite the growing awareness of these risks,
current cybersecurity practices and regulatory
frameworks often lacks in addressing the unique
challenges posed by converged environments. Many
organizations lack comprehensive policies tailored to
hybrid IT-OT systems, while technical architectures
frequently do not incorporate security-by-design
principles for legacy OT assets. Additionally,
implementation efforts are hampered by siloed
operations, insufficient cross-domain expertise, and the
absence of real-time monitoring and response
mechanisms that span both IT and OT ecosystems.
This paper aims to investigate the policy,
architectural, and implementation challenges in securing
IT-OT convergence within CPS, with a specific focus on
critical infrastructure systems. It provides a

comprehensive review of existing literature, highlights
key gaps in current practices, and outlines general
guidelines and checkpoints for a layered security
framework grounded in defense-in-depth and zero-trust

aspects, this study seeks to contribute to the
development of resilient, adaptive, and secure CPS
environments capable of withstanding evolving cyber
threats.

2 Background / Literature review
Critical infrastructure sectors rely heavily on Industrial
Control Systems (ICS) to function. In critical
infrastructure sectors, the integration of IT and OT
inside CPS has become both a technological
requirement and a security challenge. Numerous studies
and reports related to vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and
security strategies applicable to OT have underscored
the increasing complexity and vulnerability resulting
from this convergence. [1]
2.1 Nature of ICS and unique security
challenges
Traditional IT security solutions often fall short in ICS
environments due to the latter’s unique requirements for
high availability, legacy equipment, and real-time
performance. According to Maglaras et al. [2], ICS were
originally designed for reliability and efficiency, not for
cybersecurity. The integration of these systems with
external networks has created new attack surfaces,
which traditional security models are ill-equipped to
handle.
Hajda et al. [3] emphasize that legacy protocols (e.g.,
Modbus, DNP3) commonly used in ICS lack basic
encryption and authentication features. This makes them
susceptible to various attacks such as spoofing, replay
attacks, and man-in-the-middle intrusions.
2.2 Major threats and vulnerabilities
Recent literature highlights several high-profile
incidents—such as Stuxnet, BlackEnergy, and the
TRITON malware—as illustrative of the real-world
impact of ICS vulnerabilities. Ara [4] identifies common
vulnerabilities in SCADA systems, including weak
authentication mechanisms, lack of proper
segmentation, and insufficient monitoring.
Makrakis et al. [5] provide a comprehensive survey
of attack vectors in ICS, including insider threats, supply
chain attacks, and malware targeting PLCs. These
attacks exploit both technical weaknesses and
operational oversights.
From a threat perspective, Zografopoulos et al. [6]
focus on CPS in energy infrastructure, identifying
specific attack vectors such as network injection and
false data injection. Similarly, Kumar and Vardhan [7]
offer a comprehensive tutorial of OT-specific
vulnerabilities and mitigation practices, detailing legacy
system challenges and real-time threat detection
requirements. Claroty [8] and TXOne Networks [9]
reinforce these findings with global surveys showing
that ransomware and third-party risks are escalating,
particularly in unpatched or segmented OT
environments.
2.3 Emerging security solutions
Multiple studies have proposed solutions tailored to the
constraints of ICS environments. Umer et al. [10]
explore the application of machine learning (ML)
techniques for anomaly detection in ICS traffic, which
can help identify zero-day threats without relying on
predefined signatures.
Varghese et al. [11] introduces the concept of Digital
Twins for ICS security—a virtual replica of physical
systems that can simulate and predict behaviours,
enabling advanced intrusion detection.
Emerging cybersecurity paradigms like Zero-Trust
and defense-in-depth are examined in Lawal [12] and
AlertEnterprise [13]. These papers stress the need for
contextual identity, policy automation, and convergence
of physical and cyber layers. Cryptographic advances
are addressed in Mosteiro-Sanchez et al. [14] and Oliva
del Moral et al. [15], which advocate for post-quantum
cryptography and attribute-based encryption to secure
Industrial IoT (IIoT) within CPS frameworks.
Surveys such as Ahmed and Zhou [16] and Sechi
[17] contribute a broader academic perspective,
discussing the integration of physical-aware security
models and the role of cascading failure consequences.
Armis [18] identifies five emerging priorities, such as
integrated monitoring and AI-based threat hunting,
which are increasingly vital due to rising OT asset
connectivity.
Other researchers advocate for a defense-in-depth
approach, involving layered security controls,
segmentation of network, intrusion detection systems

(IDS), and strict access management. Frameworks such
as IEC 62443 and NIST SP 800-82 provide structured
guidelines for securing ICS environments. [19]
In terms of implementation, Fortinet [20] presents an
OT security platform approach, integrating nextgeneration firewalls, virtual patching, and microsegmentation to mitigate lateral movement of threats.
RedSeal (a leader in network exposure management)
highlights the challenge of legacy system exposure,
proposing visibility and risk scoring mechanisms to
support continuous compliance in hybrid IT-OT
networks. Some researchers proposes firewall
optimization algorithms to dynamically manage
segmentation in power grid systems, while few others
compared deployment strategies across water and power
sectors, identifying bottlenecks in policy enforcement
and technical execution.
2.4 Policy and human factors
Several studies point out the critical role of policy,
training, and organizational culture. According to
Kaspersky ICS-CERT, human error and lack of
cybersecurity awareness are major contributors to ICS
breaches. Regular training, incident response planning,
and clear security policies are emphasized as necessary
components of a holistic security strategy.
Foundational policy insights are provided by the
NSTAC IT-OT Convergence Report and NIST SP 800-
82r3, which outline the regulatory gaps and suggest
architectural frameworks tailored to the unique needs of
OT environments. They emphasize risk-based
segmentation, asset inventory, and standardized
protocols to harmonize security across IT and OT layers.
2.5 Summary
While considerable strides have been made in visibility
and segmentation technologies, the literature
consistently highlights enduring challenges in legacy
OT integration, regulatory fragmentation, and
organizational inertia. Therefore, a unified, risk-centric,
and resilience-oriented approach remains critical to
securing IT-OT convergence in critical infrastructure
CPS environments.
Collectively, these works converge on key themes:
• The urgent need for standardized policy,
• Architectural adaptation for hybrid networks, and
• Implementation of intelligent and layered
defenses.
3 Cyber-physical system architecture
The Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA),
or Purdue Model given in Figure 1, is a widely adopted
framework for structuring ICS and CPS. It provides a
hierarchical model that separates enterprise IT systems
from OT systems, creating a structured framework for
defense-in-depth and enabling better management,
security, and integration.
3.1 Overview of the purdue model
The model is 7-layer framework and segments networks
into zones based on function and security needs, with a
DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) acting as a buffer between
IT and OT networks. The model, while commonly
presented with 6 levels, can be extended to 7 by
including a DMZ (Level 3.5) between the IT and OT
layers. This allows for controlled communication and
protection of critical OT systems.
Here's a breakdown of the 7 layers, including the
DMZ:
1. Level 0: Physical Process Zone: This is the
bottommost level, containing the physical
equipment and processes e.g. sensors, actuators,
and machinery.
2. Level 1: Intelligent Devices Zone: This level
includes devices like PLCs and DCS that directly
manage the physical processes.
3. Level 2: Control Systems Zone: This level houses
SCADA systems, which monitor and control the
processes at a higher level.
4. Level 3: Manufacturing Operations Systems
Zone: This zone includes systems like historians,
alarm servers, and other systems that monitor and
manage manufacturing operations.
5. Level 3.5: DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): This
crucial level acts as a buffer between the IT and
OT networks, filtering and regulating traffic to
protect OT systems.
6. Level 4/5: Enterprise Zone/Network: This level
includes corporate systems like Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) in Level 4
(Enterprise Zone) and the highest level,
encompassing corporate IT systems like email
and file storage in Level 5 (Enterprise Network)

ITM Web of Conferences 79, 01005 (2025) https://doi.org/10.1051/itmconf/20257901005
KEIS-2025
The Purdue model, along with frameworks like
NIST 800-82 and IEC 62443, enables a structured
approach for securing ICS networks by isolating
different parts of the organization's layers. The DMZ is
a key component, ensuring controlled communication
and protection of critical systems.
3.2 IT and OT convergence in the purdue model
Traditionally, IT (Levels 4–5) and OT (Levels 0–3)
operated in silos. However, modern CPS demand
seamless integration for real-time analytics, predictive
maintenance, and adaptive control. This convergence
introduces new challenges:
1. Data Flow: Real-time data from OT must be
securely transmitted to IT systems for analysis
and decision-making.
2. Security Zones: Each level must be segmented
with firewalls and DMZs to prevent lateral
movement of threats.
3. Protocol Bridging: Integration requires
translation between IT protocols (e.g., TCP/IP,
HTTPS) and OT protocols (e.g., Modbus, OPC
UA).
4 Security challenges in IT/OT
convergence
The IT and OT convergence increases the attack surface
to large extent and needs to be analyzed and mitigated
timely to avoid any untoward incidents. The CPS is
further vulnerable to risks due to physical asset types
and at times due to unmanned and unprotected
location/zones to integrate physical processes with
computing systems.
Understanding the distinctions between IT and OT
cybersecurity is crucial for planning effective security
strategies, especially as these domains increasingly
converge in modern infrastructures like smart grids.
4.1 Threat landscape
The threat landscape and collaboration between
attackers are exponentially increasing making all
connected system much more vulnerable to threats.
1. Ransomware: These attacks have increasingly
targeted industrial environments, encrypting
critical OT systems and demanding payment for
decryption. These attacks can hamper production
lines, disrupt supply chains, and result in large
financial losses. Notable examples include the
Locker Goga and EKANS ransomware strains,
which specifically target ICS environments.
2. Insider Threats: Insiders whether malicious or
negligent—pose a unique risk due to their access
to both IT and OT systems. A disgruntled
employee or a contractor with elevated privileges
can bypass security controls, manipulate process
data, or disable safety systems.
3. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): APTs are
long-term, targeted attacks often orchestrated by
nation-state actors. These threats are particularly
dangerous in CPS environments due to their
stealthy nature and ability to remain undetected
for extended periods. APTs often exploit IT/OT
integration points to move laterally across
networks.
4.2 Vulnerabilities in converged environments
1. Legacy Systems: Many OT systems were
designed decades ago with little consideration for
cybersecurity. These systems often run outdated
software, lack encryption, and cannot be easily
patched without disrupting operations.
2. Lack of Network Segmentation: Inadequate
segmentation between IT and OT networks
allows attackers to pivot from compromised IT
systems into critical OT infrastructure. Flat
network architectures are especially vulnerable to
lateral movement.
3. Protocol Weaknesses: OT protocols such as
Modbus, DNP3, and BACnet were not originally
built with security considerations, often lacking
essential safeguards such as authentication,
encryption, and integrity verification. As a result,
they are vulnerable to threats like spoofing,
replay attacks, and man-in-the-middle exploits.
5 Policy and governance frameworks
Effective policy and governance frameworks are
essential for securing the IT and OT networks
convergence in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). These
frameworks provide the foundation for implementing
security controls, ensuring compliance, and managing
risks across diverse technological domains.
5.1 Regulatory standards
Several international standards guide the development
and enforcement of cybersecurity policies in CPS
environments:
1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): It is
developed by the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology and provides a
flexible, risk-based approach to managing
cybersecurity. It includes five core functions:
Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover,
which are applicable across both IT and OT
domains.
2. IEC 62443: Developed by the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), to
specifically addresses security for Industrial
Automation and Control Systems (IACS). It
defines roles, responsibilities, and technical
requirements for securing OT environments,
including system integrators and asset owners.
3. ISO/IEC-27001: This standard outlines
requirements for establishing, implementing,
maintaining, and continually improving an
Information Security Management System
(ISMS). It is widely used in IT environments and
4
ITM Web of Conferences 79, 01005 (2025) https://doi.org/10.1051/itmconf/20257901005
KEIS-2025
increasingly adopted in OT settings to ensure
consistent security governance.
5.2 Policy models
1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC
restricts system access based on user roles and
responsibilities. In CPS, it ensures that operators,
engineers, and administrators have access only to
the systems and data necessary for their tasks,
reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.
2. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Zero Trust
assumes that no user or device is inherently
trustworthy, even within the network perimeter.
It enforces continuous verification, least privilege
access, and micro-segmentation. ZTA is
particularly effective in IT/OT environments
where traditional perimeter-based security is
insufficient.
5.3 Compliance challenges
Despite the availability of robust standards and
models, organizations face several challenges in
implementing and enforcing cybersecurity policies:
1. Interoperability Issues: IT and OT systems often
use different protocols and platforms, making
unified policy enforcement difficult.
2. Legacy Infrastructure: Many OT systems lack the
capability to support modern security controls,
such as encryption or authentication.
3. Cultural Divide: IT and OT teams may have
differing priorities and risk perceptions, leading
to inconsistent policy adoption.
4. Resource Constraints: Budget limitations and
skill shortages can hinder the deployment of
comprehensive governance frameworks.
5. Audit and Monitoring: Continuous compliance
monitoring is complex due to the dynamic nature
of CPS and the need for real-time operations.
6 Secure architecture design
Designing a secure architecture for CPS is critical to
ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
both IT and OT environments. As these systems become
increasingly interconnected, a layered and resilient
security architecture becomes essential to defend against
evolving cyber threats.
6.1 Segmentation strategies
6.1.1 IT/OT Network Segmentation
It is the foundational principle of secure CPS
architecture. Dividing the network into distinct zones
limits the spread of threats and enforce access control.
• Zoning: Separate IT and OT networks into
different security zones.
• Conduits: Define controlled communication
paths between zones.
• Access Control Lists (ACLs): Restrict traffic
between segments based on roles and protocols.
6.1.2 Demilitarized zones (DMZs)
It acts as a buffer zone between IT and OT networks,
hosting services that require access from both domains
(e.g., data historians, remote access gateways).
• Dual Firewalls: One facing the IT network, the
other facing the OT network.
• Proxy Servers: Mediate communication to
prevent direct access.
• Data Diodes: Enforce unidirectional data flow for
critical systems.
6.2 Security controls
6.2.1 Firewalls
Firewalls enforce perimeter security by filtering traffic
based on predefined rules. In CPS, both traditional and
industrial firewalls are used to protect control networks.
• Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): For protocolaware filtering (e.g., Modbus, DNP3).
• Application Layer Gateways: For inspecting
SCADA traffic.
6.2.2 Intrusion detection and prevention systems
(IDS/IPS)
These IDS systems monitor network traffic for signs of
malicious activity and can be classified as under:
• Signature-Based: Detect known threats using
predefined patterns.
• Anomaly-Based: Detects irregularities from
established behavioral norms, making them
particularly effective in OT environments where
network traffic tends to follow consistent
patterns.
6.2.3 Anomaly detection systems
Machine learning-based systems can detect subtle
anomalies in sensor data, control commands, or network
behaviour, providing early warning of potential attacks.
6.3 Resilience mechanisms
6.3.1 Redundancy
Redundant systems ensure continued operation in case
of hardware or software failure.
• Hot Standby Systems: Automatically take over if
the primary system fails.
• Redundant Communication Paths: Prevent single
points of failure in network infrastructure.
5
ITM Web of Conferences 79, 01005 (2025) https://doi.org/10.1051/itmconf/20257901005
KEIS-2025
6.3.2 Failover systems
Failover mechanisms switch operations to backup
systems during outages or attacks, minimizing
downtime.
• Automated Failover: Triggered by system health
checks or anomaly detection.
• Manual Override: Allows operators to intervene
in critical situations.
6.3.3 Incident response and recovery
A well-defined incident response plan helps to minimize
the impact of security breaches.
• Detection and Containment: Rapid identification
and isolation of affected systems.
• Eradication and Recovery: Removal of threats
and restoration of normal operations.
• Post-Incident Analysis: Lessons learned to
improve future resilience.
7 Implementation challenges
Secure implementation of IT and OT presents a range of
technical, organizational, and financial challenges.
These challenges must be addressed holistically to
ensure a resilient and scalable security posture.
7.1 Technical barriers
7.1.1 Interoperability
IT and OT systems often use different communication
protocols, data formats, and hardware platforms.
Integrating these systems securely requires:
• Protocol translation (e.g., Modbus to TCP/IP)
• Middleware solutions for data normalization
• Secure APIs for cross-domain communication
7.1.2 Legacy systems
Many OT environments rely on legacy equipment that
lacks modern security features such as encryption,
authentication, or patching capabilities. These systems
are often mission-critical and cannot be easily replaced
or taken offline for updates.
7.1.3 Real-time constraints
OT systems operate under strict real-time requirements.
Security measures such as deep packet inspection or
encryption can introduce latency, potentially disrupting
time-sensitive operations like process control or safety
mechanisms.
7.2 Organizational issues
7.2.1 Skill gaps
There is a shortage of professionals with expertise in
both IT security and OT operations. This gap hinders the
development and deployment of integrated security
strategies.
• IT professionals may lack understanding of
industrial protocols and safety requirements.
• OT engineers may be unfamiliar with
cybersecurity principles and tools.
7.2.2 Cultural differences
IT and OT teams often have different priorities and risk
tolerances:
• IT Focus: Data confidentiality, uptime, and patch
management.
• OT Focus: Safety, availability, and deterministic
performance.
Bridging this cultural divide requires cross-training,
collaboration, and unified governance.
7.3 Cost and scalability
7.3.1 Budget constraints
Implementing comprehensive security solutions across
both IT and OT domains can be costly. Expenses
include:
• Hardware upgrades (e.g., secure PLCs, firewalls)
• Software licenses (e.g., IDS/IPS, SIEM)
• Training and staffing
• Organizations must balance security investments
with operational budgets, often prioritizing shortterm functionality over long-term resilience.
7.3.2 Scalability of security solutions
As CPS environments grow in complexity and scale,
security solutions must adapt accordingly. Challenges
include:
• Managing a growing number of endpoints and
sensors
• Ensuring consistent policy enforcement across
distributed sites
• Scaling monitoring and incident response
capabilities
8 Discussion
The convergence of IT and OT networks in CPS
represents a transformative shift in how industrial and
critical infrastructure systems are designed, operated,
and secured. This chapter reflects on the broader
implications of the research, acknowledges its
limitations, and outlines directions for future work.

KEIS-2025
8.1 Implications
8.1.1 Industry impact
The integration of IT and OT enables analytics based on
real-time data, predictive maintenance, and increases
operational efficiency [1]. However, it also introduces
new vulnerabilities that require robust security
architectures. Industries such as manufacturing, energy,
transportation, and healthcare must adopt layered
security strategies to protect against cyber threats
without compromising operational continuity.
8.1.2 Policy and governance
The findings underscore the need for unified
cybersecurity policies that bridge the gap between IT
and OT domains. Regulatory frameworks like NIST,
IEC 62443, and ISO/IEC 27001 must be adapted and
enforced across sectors to ensure consistent security
postures. Governments and industry bodies should
collaborate to develop sector-specific guidelines and
compliance mechanisms.
8.1.3 Future CPS design
Security must be embedded into the design phase of
CPS rather than added as an afterthought. This includes
secure-by-design hardware, protocol-aware firewalls,
and AI-driven anomaly detection systems. Future CPS
architectures should prioritize modularity, scalability,
and resilience to adapt to evolving threats.
8.2 Limitations
While this research provides a comprehensive overview
of secure CPS architecture, several limitations must be
acknowledged:
1. Scope of Case Studies: The analysis focused on a
limited number of high-profile incidents. Broader
empirical studies across different industries could
provide deeper insights.
2. Technology Assumptions: The proposed
frameworks assume the availability of modern
hardware and software, which may not be
feasible in all legacy environments.
3. Simulation and Validation: Due to the conceptual
nature of the work, proposed models and
strategies are not validated through real-world
deployment or simulation.
8.3 Future work
To build upon this research, the following areas are
recommended for further exploration:
1. AI-Driven Security: Explore the use of machine
learning for real-time threat detection and
adaptive response in CPS environments.
2. Digital Twin Integration: Explore how digital
twins can be used to simulate and test security
architectures before deployment.
3. Cross-Domain Policy Enforcement: Develop
frameworks for unified policy management
across IT and OT systems, including automated
compliance auditing.
4. Human Factors: Study the impact of
organizational culture, training, and human error
on the effectiveness of CPS security strategies.
9 Conclusion
This research explored the multifaceted challenges and
solutions associated with securing the convergence of IT
and OT in CPS. Key contributions include:
1. Architectural Insights: The use of the Purdue
Model to structure CPS environments and
highlight integration points between IT and OT.
2. Threat Analysis: A detailed examination of the
evolving threat landscape, including
ransomware, insider threats, and advanced
persistent threats (APTs).
3. Security Frameworks: Evaluation of regulatory
standards such as NIST, IEC 62443, and ISO/IEC
27001, along with policy models like Role-Based
Access Control (RBAC) and Zero Trust
Architecture (ZTA).
4. Design Strategies: Recommendations for secure
architecture design, including segmentation,
firewalls, IDS/IPS, and resilience mechanisms.
5. Implementation Challenges: Identification of
technical, organizational, and financial barriers to
secure IT/OT integration.
As CPS become increasingly central to critical
infrastructure and industrial operations, the secure
convergence of IT and OT is no longer optional—it is
imperative. The complexity of these systems demands a
holistic approach that combines technical controls,
governance frameworks, and cross-disciplinary
collaboration.
Security must be embedded into the design,
deployment, and operation of CPS from the outset.
Organizations must invest in not only technology but
also in people and processes to build a culture of
cybersecurity that spans both IT and OT domains.
Ultimately, the future of CPS depends on our ability
to create architectures that are not only intelligent and
efficient but also resilient and secure.
