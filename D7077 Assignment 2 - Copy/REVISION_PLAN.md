# Revision Plan for D7077E Assignment 2

## Secondary Feedback Issues to Address:

### 1. Conceptualization Section
**Current Issue:** Reads like SMS conversation - fragmented, bullet-point style
**Target:** Coherent, fluent, readable prose
**Sections to revise:**
- AIC prioritization explanation
- Security building blocks integration into narrative flow
- Connection between rationale and implementation

### 2. Analysis Section
**Current Issue:** Weak; enumerates strengths/weaknesses without reflection
**Target:** Analytical depth - finding meaning in the results
**Needed improvements:**
- Deeper reflection on trade-offs and implications
- Analysis of what the architecture means for the organization
- How design choices interact and reinforce each other
- Consideration of real-world constraints and organizational impact

### 3. Summary and Conclusions
**Current Issue:** Lacks analytical depth; too brief
**Target:** Synthesize insights and demonstrate reflective thinking
**Needed improvements:**
- Tie concepts together meaningfully
- Discuss broader implications
- Reflect on lessons learned
- Make it engaging and thought-provoking

## Revision Approach:
Each section will be discussed, refined collaboratively, and implemented with a dedicated markdown file tracking the changes.
