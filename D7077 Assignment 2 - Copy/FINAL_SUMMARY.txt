HOW TO INTEGRATE INTO YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: Open your current assignment document
        (D7077E Assignment-2 stente-5.docx or .txt)

STEP 2: Replace the three weak sections:
        • Delete current "Conceptualization..." section
        • Paste content from REVISED_CONCEPTUALIZATION.md
        
        • Delete current "Analysis of strengths and weaknesses..." section
        • Paste content from REVISED_ANALYSIS.md
        
        • Delete current "Summary and conclusions" section
        • Paste content from REVISED_SUMMARY.md

STEP 3: Update References section with:
        [1] Raich, R., Raich, A., & Kinhekar, N. (2025)
        [2] Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA)
        [3] Alladi, T., Chamola, V., & Zeadally, S. (2020)
        [4] Mesbah, M., Elsayed, M. S., Jurcut, A. D., & Azer, M. (2023)
        [5] Bukhari, T. T., et al. (2019)
        [6] Ravi, C. S., et al. (2025)

STEP 4: Proofread for formatting consistency

STEP 5: Submit with confidence

HOW THESE REVISIONS ADDRESS YOUR PROFESSOR'S FEEDBACK:
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECONDARY FEEDBACK #1: "Coherent/fluent text (not SMS conversation)"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ADDRESSED BY: REVISED_CONCEPTUALIZATION.md

What Changed:
  • 10 bullet points → 4 flowing paragraphs
  • Isolated concepts → Integrated system narrative
  • Choppy sentences → Smooth prose transitions
  • Reads as unified argument → Not a checklist

Example:
  BEFORE: "Layered Network Segmentation: According to PERA [1]..."
  AFTER:  "The foundation of this architecture rests on layered network
           segmentation based on the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture
           (PERA) model, which divides the OT environment into distinct
           functional layers... [^1][^2]"

Result: Section now reads as professional academic text, not enumerated list.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECONDARY FEEDBACK #2: "Analysis too weak, find meaning not enumerate outcomes"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ADDRESSED BY: REVISED_ANALYSIS.md

What Changed:
  • Weak explanations → Deep analysis with implications
  • "Here's the fact" → "Here's the fact AND why it matters"
  • No context → Manufacturing/operational context throughout
  • Enumeration → Reflective analysis

Example:
  BEFORE: "The three independent production lines enable 66% operation..."
  AFTER:  "...This matters in real life because customers with just-in-time
           contracts accept reduced deliveries (2 of 3 lines) far more readily
           than complete stoppage (0 of 3 lines). The difference between 66%
           and 0% is the difference between maintaining customer relationships
           and triggering supply chain crises..."

Result: Each point now demonstrates understanding of real-world implications.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECONDARY FEEDBACK #3: "Summary too weak, use reflective abilities, make interesting"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ADDRESSED BY: REVISED_SUMMARY.md

What Changed:
  • Technical recap → Synthesized insights
  • Weak statements → Thought-provoking reflections
  • Repetitive → Novel analysis not seen before
  • Boring → Compelling conclusions about OT security

Example:
  BEFORE: "...effective OT security is pragmatic and realistic security. It
           succeeds by aligning availability protection with business objectives..."
  AFTER:  "...effective OT security is pragmatic and realistic, succeeding by
           aligning security priorities with business objectives rather than
           pursuing security ideals that conflict with operational requirements.
           The architecture tolerates 16-hour delays in patch deployment because
           production continuity matters more than instantly patching every
           vulnerability... This pragmatism is not a weakness—it is the difference
           between security that works in the real world and security that fails
           when operational pressures override theoretical ideals."

Result: Conclusions now demonstrate reflective thinking and are interesting to read.

QUALITY METRICS:
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONCEPTUALIZATION:
  ✓ Coherence: Flows logically from network → access → monitoring → synthesis
  ✓ Narrative: Reads as professional academic text, not checklist
  ✓ Scholarship: 6 sources integrated naturally as footnotes
  ✓ Manufacturing Context: 24/7 ops, supply chains, downtime discussed
  ✓ Length: ~2,000 words (appropriate for detailed section)

ANALYSIS:
  ✓ Depth: Each point explained with real-world implications
  ✓ Reflection: Shows understanding of operational consequences
  ✓ Business Impact: Customer contracts, supply chains, SLAs discussed
  ✓ Balance: 3 strengths and 6 weaknesses (comprehensive coverage)
