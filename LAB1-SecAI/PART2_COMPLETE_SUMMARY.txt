├─ What is APR defense?
├─ Why are cats vulnerable?
├─ What's the security-accuracy trade-off?
└─ How can attackers adapt?

├─ 6.6 average generations (efficiency)
├─ 31% success on APR defense (effectiveness)
├─ Class-specific vulnerabilities (why)
├─ 4.58% accuracy drop trade-off (worth it?)
└─ Paper comparison (what we reproduced)

================================================================================
                    KEY POINTS
================================================================================

THE ATTACK:
├─ One pixel change fools neural network
├─ 43% of images vulnerable (huge!)
├─ Differential Evolution finds perturbation efficiently
├─ 6.6 generations average (330 network queries)
└─ Cats most vulnerable (81.8%)

THE DEFENSE:
├─ Three components working together
├─ Reduces attack success from 43% to 31%
├─ Costs 4.58% accuracy
├─ 27.9% relative improvement
└─ Trade-off is reasonable

THE VULNERABILITY:
├─ Similar classes most vulnerable
├─ Cats vs Dogs: 81.8% vs 35%
├─ Confused decision boundaries
├─ Single pixel in confusion zone causes flip

THE LIMITATION:
├─ Defense not perfect
├─ Attackers can adapt (multi-pixel, more compute)
├─ No perfect defense exists
└─ Arms race continues

================================================================================
                    QUICK FACTS TO TELL PROFESSOR
================================================================================

THE ATTACK:
"43% of CIFAR-10 test images are vulnerable to one-pixel attacks,
showing neural networks' brittleness. I used Differential Evolution
(population-based optimization) which found attacks in ~7 generations."

THE DEFENSE:
"APR combines adversarial training, pixel-wise attention, and gradient
regularization. It reduces attack success from 43% to 31%."

THE TRADE-OFF:
"Defense costs 4.58% accuracy (76.69% → 72.11%) to gain 12% robustness.
This is a reasonable trade-off for security-critical applications."

THE INSIGHT:
"Similar-looking classes (cats, birds) are most vulnerable (81.8%)
because the network's decision boundary is confused."

THE LIMIT:
"Determined attackers can adapt using multi-pixel attacks or more
computational budget. No perfect defense exists."
