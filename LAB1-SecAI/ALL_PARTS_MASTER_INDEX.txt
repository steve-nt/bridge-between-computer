================================================================================
                    RECOMMENDED APPROACH
================================================================================

WITH YOUR PROFESSOR:

1. Show them the commented code files
   "Here's my implementation with detailed comments..."
   → Opens .py files
   → Shows full understanding

2. Walk through key algorithms
   "The one-pixel attack uses Differential Evolution..."
   → Reference DETAILED_EXPLANATION files
   → Show exact code lines

3. Explain the results
   "43% of images are vulnerable because..."
   → Reference RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md
   → Show numbers and patterns

4. Discuss trade-offs and limitations
   "The defense costs 4.58% accuracy but..."
   → Reference RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md
   → Explain why trade-off is reasonable

5. Be ready for deep questions
   "Well, let me show you in the code..."
   → Reference .py files with comments
   → Can explain any line

THIS APPROACH = VERY IMPRESSIVE TO PROFESSOR
