================================================================================
                    KEY POINTS YOU CAN EXPLAIN
================================================================================

PART I - k-NN:
✓ Preprocessing reduces dimensionality and focuses on structure
✓ Normalization by 255 increased accuracy 3x (26% → 81%)
✓ L1 slightly better than L2 for normalized MNIST
✓ k=1 best, larger k introduces confusion
✓ O(N) prediction makes it slow for large datasets

PART II - Neural Networks:
✓ Sigmoid activation provides non-linearity (essential!)
✓ Softmax converts outputs to probabilities
✓ Forward propagation computes predictions
✓ Backpropagation computes gradients via chain rule
✓ Gradient descent updates weights with learning rate
✓ Neural networks achieve 97.44% accuracy (15% better than k-NN)
✓ Trade-off: slower training, faster prediction, true generalization

THE BUG & FIX:
✓ Bug: Raw pixels [0-255] dominated by brightness
✓ Fix: Normalize to [0-1] range
✓ Impact: 26% → 81% accuracy (3x improvement!)
✓ Lesson: Data preprocessing is critical

================================================================================
                    EXAMPLE: HOW TO EXPLAIN A CODE SECTION
================================================================================

Your professor asks: "Explain the center function and why we use it"

You can say:
"In Task 1.1, we defined a center() function. Let me show you the code..."

[Show kNN_DETAILED_COMMENTS.py with these lines highlighted:]
    def center(X):
        newX = X - np.mean(X, axis=0)
        return newX

"This function:
1. Calculates np.mean(X, axis=0) - the average pixel value across all images
2. Subtracts this average from every image
3. Result: Pixel values are centered around 0 instead of [0-255]

Why we do this:
- Raw pixels are dominated by overall brightness
- By centering, we focus on the STRUCTURE of digits
- This preprocessing is critical - it increased accuracy from 26% to 81%
- As shown in Task 1.4, when we didn't normalize, accuracy was very low"

[Reference COMPLETE_GUIDE_FOR_PROFESSOR.md, section "Task 1.1"]

================================================================================
                    EXAMPLE: HOW TO EXPLAIN BACKPROPAGATION
================================================================================

Your professor asks: "Explain how the backpropagation algorithm works"

You can say:
"Backpropagation is the algorithm that lets neural networks learn. It has
three steps shown in the code in Task 2:

Step 1 - Forward Propagation (forward_propagate method):
Input flows through layers: 784 → 100 → 100 → 10
Each layer applies weights and activation function
Output: softmax probabilities (should be close to true labels)

Step 2 - Backpropagation (backpropagate method):
Compute error at output: delta = prediction - truth
Propagate backwards using chain rule:
  delta_i = (W^T @ delta_next) * activation'(S_i)
This tells us how much each weight contributed to the error

Step 3 - Weight Update (update_weights method):
Update each weight: W := W - eta * gradient
This moves weights in direction that reduces error

The learning rate (eta=0.05) controls step size:
- Too small (0.005): Learning is very slow
- Too large (0.5): Training becomes unstable

This process repeats for 70 epochs, each time improving the network.
Final result: 97.44% accuracy on test set!"

[Reference ANN_DETAILED_COMMENTS.py, backpropagate method]
[Reference COMPLETE_GUIDE, Section 2.3]
